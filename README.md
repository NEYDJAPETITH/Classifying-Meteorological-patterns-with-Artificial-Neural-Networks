# CLASSIFYING METEOROLOGICAL PATTERNS WITH ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS

DURING THIS PROJECT, I TACKLED A REAL-WORLD PREDICTION PROBLEM USING MACHINE LEARNING.  I USED THIS DATA TO TRAIN AN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK TO PREDICT WHETHER IT WILL RAIN ON SATURDAY, AUGUST 26TH, 2023. THE DATASET I USED DERIVES FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, WHERE THEY RECORD DAILY WEATHER OBSERVATIONS FROM A NUMBER OF AUSTRALIAN WEATHER STATIONS. I CREATED THIS MACHINE LEARNING MODEL USING INDUSTRY STANDARD TOOLS, IN ADDITION TO PYTHON AND SKLEARN.
